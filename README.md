#🎬 IMDB Movie Analysis#

📌 Description
Understanding what makes a movie successful is crucial for producers, directors, and investors. This project analyzes IMDB movie data to identify key factors influencing high ratings. Using Excel, we clean, analyze, and visualize data to uncover insights that can drive better decision-making in the film industry.

🏆 Who Is This For?
This project is ideal for:

✔ Aspiring Data Analysts & Business Analysts looking to gain hands-on experience in entertainment analytics.
✔ Film Industry Professionals (producers, directors, investors) who want data-driven insights on movie success factors.
✔ Data Enthusiasts & Students interested in applying analytics to real-world datasets.

📊 Data Analytics Tasks
A. Movie Genre Analysis: Analyze the distribution of movie genres and their impact on the IMDB score.

Task: Determine the most common genres of movies in the dataset. Then, for each genre, calculate descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, range, variance, standard deviation) of the IMDB scores.
Hint: Use Excel's COUNTIF function to count the number of movies for each genre. You might need to manipulate the 'genres' column to separate multiple genres for a single movie. Use Excel's functions like AVERAGE, MEDIAN, MODE, MAX, MIN, VAR, and STDEV to calculate descriptive statistics. Compare the statistics to understand the impact of genre on movie ratings.

B. Movie Duration Analysis: Analyze the distribution of movie durations and its impact on the IMDB score.

Task: Analyze the distribution of movie durations and identify the relationship between movie duration and IMDB score.
Hint: Calculate descriptive statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation for movie durations. Use Excel's functions like AVERAGE, MEDIAN, and STDEV. Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between movie duration and IMDB score. Add a trendline to assess the direction and strength of the relationship.

C. Language Analysis: Situation: Examine the distribution of movies based on their language.

Task: Determine the most common languages used in movies and analyze their impact on the IMDB score using descriptive statistics.
Hint: Use Excel's COUNTIF function to count the number of movies for each language. Calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of the IMDB scores for each language. Compare the statistics to understand the impact of language on movie ratings.

D. Director Analysis: Influence of directors on movie ratings.

Task: Identify the top directors based on their average IMDB score and analyze their contribution to the success of movies using percentile calculations.
Hint: Calculate the average IMDB score for each director. Use Excel's PERCENTILE function to identify the directors with the highest scores. Compare the scores of these directors to the overall distribution of scores.

E. Budget Analysis: Explore the relationship between movie budgets and their financial success.

Task: Analyze the correlation between movie budgets and gross earnings, and identify the movies with the highest profit margin.
Hint: Calculate the correlation coefficient between movie budgets and gross earnings using Excel's CORREL function. Calculate the profit margin (gross earnings - budget) for each movie and identify the movies with the highest profit margin using Excel's MAX function.
